  </header>
  <p class="govuk-body">Companies House is an executive agency of the Department for Business
    Innovation and Skills.
    Our main functions are to incorporate and dissolve limited companies; examine and store company
    information delivered under the Companies Act and related
    legislation; and make this information available to the public.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Companies House digitally records almost all information it receives, and
    makes this available
    to the public through its own website and through the Companies House RESTful API. Being
    RESTful, each record of information is assigned a globally
    unique URI, and the operations available on each resource are directly mapped to HTTP verbs.
    Data can therefore be easily consumed by issuing simple GET requests on the required resource
    URI.
