  </header>
  <p class="govuk-body">Companies House is an executive agency of the Department for Business
    Innovation and Skills (BEIS).
    Our main functions are: to incorporate and dissolve limited companies; examine and store company
    information delivered under the Companies Act and related
    legislation; and make this information available to the public.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">Companies House digitally records almost all information it receives, and
    makes this available
    to the public through its own website and through the Companies House RESTful API. Being
    RESTful, each record of information is assigned a globally
    unique URI, and the operations available on each resource are directly mapped to HTTP verbs.
    This means data can be easily consumed by issuing simple GET requests on the required resource
    URI.
  </p>
  <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">Beta release</h2>
  <p class="govuk-body">The Companies House API and Developer Hub are currently at a
    <a class="govuk-link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle">beta
      release</a>.
    We are going through a process of user engagement to improve the API and documentation.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">
    We have a proposed approach to versioning the API and documentation that is currently being discussed in the <a class="govuk-link"
                                               href="https://forum.aws.chdev.org">Developer Hub
    Forum</a>. In the meantime, existing resources will remain as they are and can be considered as at 'version 0'.
  </p>
  <p class="govuk-body">You can refer to the <a class="govuk-link"
                                               href="https://forum.aws.chdev.org">Developer Hub
    Forum</a> for ongoing feature and documentation discussions, and announcements about upcoming
    feature releases.
