    <h2 class="govuk-heading-l">About the Companies House API</h2>
    <p class="govuk-body">Companies House digitally records almost all the information it receives
      and makes this available to the public through its website and through the Companies House
      RESTful API.
    </p>
    <p class="govuk-body">
      Being RESTful, each record of information is assigned a globally unique URI, and the
      operations available on each resource are directly mapped to HTTP verbs. Data can be easily
      consumed by issuing simple <code>GET</code> requests on the required resource URI.
